# BMI Application

BMI CACULATOR

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

BMI Application provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients. BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition.
